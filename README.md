## Functionalities

- Timer: The timer starts counting down from 5 minutes when the "Start" button is clicked. It stops when the "Stop" button is clicked or when the timer reaches zero.
- Typing Highlight: The target letters "a", "s", "d", "f", "j", "k", "l", ";" are displayed in the typing box. When the user clicks or presses these keys, they are highlighted in the box.
- Input Tracking: The input field captures the user's typing. As the user types, the input is displayed in the field, and the corresponding key in the typing box is highlighted.
- Accuracy Calculation: When the user stops typing or the timer reaches zero, the app calculates the accuracy by comparing the typed words with the target word "asdfjkl;". The accuracy is displayed as a percentage.
- Words Per Minute: The app calculates the words per minute (WPM) based on the total number of words typed within the time limit.
- Reset: The "Reset" button resets the timer, input field, typing highlights, and results.
